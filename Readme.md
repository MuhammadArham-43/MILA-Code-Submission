# MILA Code Submission

I have a strong professional coding background but most of my work is associated with organizations, like Vyro and Traversaal. For this code submission, I am submitting some of my personal projects which were mainly undertaken for learning purposes. You can find my work samples in the below description.

## CERN CMSSW Contribution

I was a CERN Summer Student in 2024, where I worked on the CMSSW public repo, and made contributions for hetereogenous hardware. The commit history is available as a fork of the original repository, and a pull request is open on the main CMSSW repository.

## Multi-Agent LLM

Developed a Multi-Agent system using CrewAI. Added custom built tools for real-time internet search and YouTube video transcription based on user query. Submitted as a take-home assignment for Traversaal.ai so used their hosted API for internet-search and the YouTubeV3 Data API for YouTube search.

## Minimalistic AutoGrad System

Attempted to replicate PyTorch's AutoGrad mechanism. Created a Directed Acyclic Graph of functions, and backpropogated over a Topological sorting over the DAG. Used the system to train a simple classification model, and was able to improve on the accuracy proving the auto gradient backprop was working.

## From-Scratch Implementations of SOTA architectures

Implemented a few architectures from CV and NLP to get a foundational understanding of the way they work. Trained on my own machines and acheived considerable performance. Some examples are as below:

</ul>
